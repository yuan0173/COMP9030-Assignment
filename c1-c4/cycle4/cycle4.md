All written report work for this assessment, **must** be completed using Markdown - for Markdown syntax, see this [linked page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Deliverables
#### Usability Testing Report
1. **Usability Test Plan**: A detailed document outlining your usability testing methodology. This should include:
    - **Objectives**: What specific aspects of usability are you testing?
    - **Participants**: Target demographics, number of participants.
    - **Tasks**: Specific scenarios and tasks participants will attempt to complete.
    - **Metrics**: How will you measure success (e.g., task completion rate, time on task, error rate subjective satisfaction)?
    - **Procedure**: Step-by-step instructions for conducting the test.
    - **Questionnaire/Interview Script**: Questions to gather qualitative feedback.
2. **Usability Test Results**: A compilation of the data collected during your usability tests (e.g., task completion data, error logs, participant comments, questionnaire responses).
3. **Usability Analysis & Recommendations Report**: A written report that:
    - Summarises your findings from the usability tests.
    - Identifies key usability issues and their severity.
    - Analyses the root causes of these issues.
    - Provides concrete, actionable recommendations for improving the site's usability, prioritising them based on impact and feasibility.

#### Marking Rubric
| Criteria | HD (85-100%) | DN (75-84%) | CR (65-74%) | P (50-64%) | F (0-49%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Test Plan Quality	| The test plan demonstrates exemplary comprehensiveness and meticulous structure. All objectives, tasks, and metrics are defined with exceptional clarity and precision, reflecting a sophisticated understanding of usability testing principles. The plan anticipates potential challenges and proactively addresses them, showing foresight and a high level of planning. | The test plan exhibits strong structure and good comprehensiveness. Objectives, tasks, and metrics are clearly defined and generally coherent, indicating a solid grasp of testing requirements. While thorough, it may lack the exceptional foresight or precision of a High Distinction. | The test plan possesses a basic structure, but there may be some clarity issues or inconsistencies in defining objectives, tasks, or metrics. While the core components are present, they may require further refinement for optimal utility or to fully meet the assignment's explicit criteria. | The test plan is poorly defined or incomplete, with significant ambiguities in objectives, tasks, or metrics. While an attempt has been made to outline a plan, it lacks the necessary detail or coherence to effectively guide a usability test, requiring substantial revisions to be functional. | The test plan is absent, fundamentally flawed, or completely inadequate, demonstrating a severe lack of understanding of the required components and methodology. No coherent plan is discernible. |
| Test Execution | Evidence of testing is thorough, systematic, and methodologically robust, with judicious and highly appropriate participant selection that aligns perfectly with the target demographic. Testing procedures are executed with precision, yielding high-fidelity and reliable data. | There is strong evidence of systematic testing, and participant selection is largely appropriate for the study's scope. The execution demonstrates competence in following established procedures, and the data collected is generally reliable. | There is some discernible evidence of testing activities, but the approach may lack systematic rigor or consistency. Participant selection might be limited or not fully aligned with the target demographic, potentially impacting the representativeness or generalizability of results. | There is little or no evidence of systematic testing, or the execution process demonstrates significant methodological flaws. Participant selection may be inappropriate or insufficient, severely undermining the validity or reliability of any collected data, making the results questionable. | There is no evidence of systematic testing, or the conducted "testing" is entirely unmethodical and yields no usable data, indicating a complete failure to execute the practical component of the assignment. |
| Data Collection & Analysis | Data collected is exceptionally rich, highly relevant, and systematically organized. The analysis presented is profoundly insightful, demonstrating an advanced capacity for critical evaluation and a nuanced interpretation of complex findings. Root causes are expertly identified, validated, and explored in depth. | Relevant data is effectively collected, and the analysis is sound and logical, leading to a mostly clear interpretation of findings. Key insights are identified, though perhaps lacking the profound depth or nuanced validation seen in higher-graded work. | Some relevant data has been collected, but the analysis tends to be basic or descriptive, with limited interpretation of its implications. Connections between data points and overarching findings may not be fully articulated, leading to a superficial understanding of root causes rather than in-depth insight. | Data collected is insufficient or poor, sparse, inconsistent, or lacks sufficient relevance, making meaningful analysis difficult. The analysis presented is superficial or fundamentally flawed, leading to misinterpretations or a failure to identify actual usability issues, or simply reiterating raw data without processing. | Insufficient or irrelevant data has been collected, rendering any attempt at analysis impossible or completely invalid. There is no discernible analysis or interpretation of findings presented. |
| Recommendations | Recommendations for improvement are highly concrete, eminently actionable, and impeccably justified by compelling evidence. They are strategically prioritized based on a clear assessment of potential impact and feasibility, offering innovative and impactful solutions that genuinely enhance user experience. | Recommendations are actionable and adequately justified, with some evidence of prioritization. They address identified issues effectively, providing practical improvements, though they might not always be the most innovative or strategically optimized solutions. | Recommendations are general in nature and may exhibit limited justification or prioritization. While they attempt to address issues, they might lack the specificity, strategic insight, or strong evidential backing needed for impactful improvements, making their implementation less straightforward. | Recommendations are vague, impractical, or missing. They are vague, largely impractical, or significantly underspecified. They may not directly address the identified issues, or they lack any discernible justification or prioritization, providing minimal actionable guidance for improvement. | Recommendations are missing entirely, or those provided are nonsensical, utterly impractical, and completely unfounded, demonstrating a profound disconnect from the project's objectives or findings. |
| Report Clarity | The report is outstandingly well-organized, highly professional, and characterized by exceptional clarity and conciseness. It employs precise academic language and sophisticated presentation, facilitating effortless comprehension of complex information and demonstrating superior communication skills. | The report is well-organized and clearly written, maintaining a professional tone. Information is generally accessible and easy to follow, with minor areas where conciseness or academic precision could be improved without significantly hindering comprehension. | The report demonstrates acceptable organization, but there are noticeable clarity issues or instances of imprecise language that can hinder reader comprehension. Professionalism is evident but inconsistent, and the overall narrative may occasionally be difficult to follow. | The report is disorganized, unclear, or difficult to read due to fundamental errors in structure, grammar, or expression. It may fail to convey essential information effectively, making it a challenge for the reader to understand the project. | The report is illegible, incoherent, or largely incomplete, failing to meet the basic requirements of academic communication. It is impossible to ascertain the project's intent or outcomes due to severe structural or linguistic deficiencies. |
| Oral Presentation	The presentation is exceptionally engaging and persuasive, delivering a crystal-clear and compelling explanation of the methodology, key findings, and proposed recommendations. It demonstrates a deep command of the subject matter and effectively articulates complex ideas with confidence and professionalism. | The presentation provides a clear explanation of methodology, findings, and recommendations. It is well-structured and conveys information effectively, though it may lack the dynamic engagement or exceptional depth of insight characteristic of a High Distinction. | The explanation of methodology, findings, and recommendations is understandable, but it may lack depth or clarity or logical flow, making it challenging for the audience to fully grasp complex details or the significance of the findings. The presentation might also lack engagement or confidence. | The presentation is unclear, disorganized, or difficult to follow. The explanation of key components is fragmented or confusing, making it challenging for the audience to understand the project's scope, findings, or recommendations, indicating a lack of preparedness or synthesis. | The presentation is absent, unintelligible, or completely off-topic, demonstrating a failure to engage with the assignment requirements or communicate any relevant information about the usability evaluation. |

For this assessment task, students can use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the development of their submission. Students are permitted to use AI to brainstorm ideas or provide ideas on structuring of documents. They cannot create written content using AI (e.g. sentences, paragraphs, etc.). Students are required to provide AI prompts used and drafts of their work and acknowledge how they used AI in their final submission.

#### How should the use of AI be acknowledged in the assessment task?
Students must submit a separate document with their video pitch.  The document should provide a declaration acknowledging which AI technologies have been used and how.  Drafts should be kept demonstrating authorship and may be requested by assessors. An appendix containing all prompts and output generated from AI should be included with the final submission.

For example: 
- I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT in the early stages of brainstorming the research ideas for this project (OpenAI, Year). The prompts and output from ChatGPT are included in Appendix A.

A reference to the use of AI should be included in the reference list. 

For example:
- (Year). ChatGPT (Month, Year, Version) [Large language model]. https://<!--comments-->chat.openai.<!--comment-->com/chat

**Academic Integrity**\
The misuse of generative AI or the failure to acknowledge the use of generative AI will be considered a breach of [Academic Integrity](https://students.flinders.edu.au/my-course/academic-integrity).

All work submitted should be the work of the authors, unless appropriately cited. Claiming work that is not your own is a breach of the University’s Academic Integrity Policy and suspected breaches will be reviewed and reported where appropriate. Penalties for breaches can range from 0 marks for the assignment, 0 marks for the topic, or expulsion from the University.
