### 3.3 Information Architecture Rationale

This structure directly supports our defined user flows:
- **Task 1-2**: Admin functions centralized in dedicated panel
- **Task 3**: Profile management integrated with submission tracking  
- **Task 4**: Clear submission pathway from authentication to upload
- **Task 5**: Intuitive browsing flow from map to detailed content

The architecture prioritizes **cultural sensitivity** through graduated access controls while maintaining **educational accessibility** for users like Sarah who need efficient resource discovery.

### 3.4 Page Relationships
Home ←→ Arts Listings ←→ Art Details
↓           ↓              ↓
Login → User Profile → Submit Art → My Submissions
↓                                      ↓
Admin Panel ←→ Content Moderation ←→ User Management

This interconnected structure ensures users can efficiently complete their primary tasks while maintaining clear pathways between related functions.

## 4. Low-Fidelity Wireframes

### Wireframe 1 – Homepage (FlowDiagram 9.0)

The homepage is the main entry for all to display a visually appealing introduction to the "Indigenous Art Atlas.", public visitor can browse arts listings and filter their preference. The first part is a banner to show the Atlas profile with an abstract introduction. There is a prominent interactive map showcasing approved art locations under the banner. And then, featured arts showcase a selection of recently added or featured art entries with details includes title, description and author avatar. At the bottom part, there are many quick links include links to "About Us," "Usage Guidelines," and "Contact Us" pages.

![Wireframe Home](./imgs/WireframesHomepage.png)

### Wireframe 2 – Login Page (FlowDiagram 7.0)

The website is redirect to login page when visitor click the login button. The login feature requires visitor's email and password to authenticate the identity. And visitors can start registration here by click the link of sign up if they don't have an account. 

![Wireframe Login](./imgs/WireframesLogin.png)

### Wireframe 3 – Art Listings (FlowDiagram 9.1)

There is a dedicated page displaying all approved art entries in a gallery or list format. Each item display a thumbnail image, title, and a brief description. Visitor can fliter the arts by several options, and the default sorting method is by added date.

![Wireframe Art Listings](./imgs/WireframesArtListings.png)

### Wireframe 4 – Art Details (FlowDiagram 13.0)

Each art entry have a unique page in the art detail pages, displaying all submitted details. At first, a carousel shows multiple high-resolution images of the art. Under that, left side is static map snippet showing the art's specific or general location (respecting sensitivity), and right side is comprehensive description, art type, estimated period, condition notes. After the map and description, the artist information with name and submission date is showed in the last part if the author isn't anonymous.

![Wireframe Art Details](./imgs/WireframesArtDetails.png)

### Wireframe 5 – Art Submission (FlowDiagram 8.0)

The art submission design is a multi-step or multi-section form accessible only to logged-in users. Users can start a submission with the artwork’s title, description, select predefined categories for type and period, and add condition notes. They may also credit a known artist and link submissions to an artist profile when applicable. Location information is captured through an interactive map (Leaflet.js) that allow users to drop a pin and get latitude/longitude coordinates. A sensitivity flag is included to mark culturally sensitive or private land locations for admin review and potential public masking. The form also supports multiple image uploads (JPEG, PNG) with server-side file validation for type and size.

## 5. Accessibility and Usability Considerations

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast design (4.5:1 ratio) supports users with visual impairments
- Consistent layout and clear visual hierarchy reduce cognitive load

### Motor Accessibility  
- Minimum 44px touch targets for mobile users
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements

### Cognitive Accessibility
- Simple language avoiding technical jargon (suitable for diverse educational backgrounds)
- Clear error messages and recovery guidance

### Cultural Accessibility
- Flexible privacy controls respecting Indigenous cultural protocols
- Simple upload process accommodating varying technical literacy levels

## 6. Design Rationale
### Theoretical Foundation
Our design decisions are grounded in established HCI principles:

**Nielsen's Usability Heuristics Application:**
- **Visibility of system status**: Upload progress indicators and submission status tracking
- **Match between system and real world**: Geographic map metaphor aligns with users' mental models
- **User control and freedom**: Flexible privacy settings and content management options

**Cultural Design Considerations:**
- **Community control**: Indigenous artists maintain sovereignty over their cultural content
- **Authentic representation**: Artist narratives preserved in original voice and context

Written by **Yongheng Jia(Fan:jia0318) – Rationale Writer**

Explain major design decisions and how they address personas’ goals and usability principles.
Our design decisions are guided by the two personas: Sarah (primary school art teacher) and Jason (indigenous artist).
We carried out an overall design based on the portraits of Sarah (a primary school art teacher) and Jason (an indigenous artist).
### Home Page
We placed a clear banner of heroes and introduction text, which can better showcase the cultural and educational significance of the project. The highlight is the interactive map, which provides educators or other visitors with a direct way to plan field trips or identify artworks by region. The distinctive art at the bottom makes it convenient for people to access resources and prepare for different purposes.
### Art list and filters
We have designed a search and filter option module on the page (by state, art type, and period), enabling viewers to quickly find culturally relevant examples and ensuring that the works of artists like Jason reach the right audience without getting lost in a general directory.
### Art Details page
Each work has a title, abstract, estimated period, status and space for comprehensive description to ensure academic and cultural accuracy. The author's comments added context and strengthened Jason's focus on the need to preserve cultural significance.
### Upload page
The uploaded form includes metadata (title, type, period, description) and checkboxes for cultural sensitivity, privacy, and copyright confirmation. This directly addressed Jason's demands for cultural respect and protection.
### Login page
We have tried our best to simplify the login process, using only email and passwords to facilitate users' login and reduce the trouble for teachers and art staff who may not be tech-savvy. The "Registration" link encourages community development while maintaining secure access.
Availability and accessibility

All pages follow a consistent layout and navigation, using simple typesetting and high contrast. This ensures accessibility for different users and is consistent with usability principles and classroom Settings.

## 7. User Research and Evidence

Written by **Yongheng Jia(Fan:jia0318)**

Briefly explain what user research methods were used and what insights were gained.
Our design is based on user research through character roles:
### Personality development：
#### We have constructed two characters:
- Sarah: A primary school art teacher, she wants to effectively integrate indigenous art into her teaching.
- Jason: An indigenous artist dedicated to preserving cultural significance and ensuring that artworks are respected.

- Sarah requires easy access to real teaching cases and culturally appropriate resources. This led to the inclusion of interactive maps, featured artworks and filtering systems, making the course plan faster and more reliable.
- Jason values cultural sensitivity and security, and is worried about the abuse and theft of local art. His requirements informed the guideline page, the cultural sensitivity check of the uploaded form, and the detailed description field to ensure that the appropriate context is retained.

#### The application of research results：
Both the map and the low-fidelity wireframes are directly displayed. The upload workflow reflects the cultural respect mentioned by users, and the main page also showcases the functional requirements of educators and artists, demonstrating educational significance and cultural value.
