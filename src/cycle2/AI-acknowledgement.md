## Details of AI Usage

- **Files involved**:  
  - `base.css`  
  - `components.css`  
  - `layout.css`  

These three CSS files were initially generated with the assistance of ChatGPT, which provided a **basic structural framework** for styling. I customized and adjusted the details according to the Cycle 1 visual design style, ensuring consistency with our groupâ€™s unique theme and requirements.
