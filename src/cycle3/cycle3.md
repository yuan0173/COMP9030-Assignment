#### TL;DR

Due date: **Registered Tutorial Session Week 10**\
Submission artefacts:

- Full website
- Dynamic PHP Served Content
- CRUD Functionality
- Data Persistence
- Error Handling

## Requirements
To implement a complete web site solution.  The site should provide the required functionality as defined in Cycle 1.  The site should demonstrate effective user-centric design considerations and be visually appealing and map to the Cycle 1 theme.

You will need to integrate server-side logic using PHP to enable dynamic content, user authentication (if applicable), and basic data persistence for your web application.

### Deliverables
1. PHP Backend: Implementation of server-side scripts to handle requests, process data, and interact with a simple data storage mechanism (e.g., flat files, or a very basic simulated database using PHP arrays).
1. Dynamic Content Generation: Pages that display content fetched or generated by PHP.
1. Core Functionality: Implementation of significant "Create, Read, Update, Delete" (CRUD) operations relevant to your project theme (e.g., adding/viewing/editing/deleting a product, managing user profiles, posting/reading comments).
1. Basic Data Persistence: Data should persist between user sessions (e.g., by writing to and reading from the database on the server).
1. Error Handling: Basic server-side error handling (e.g., displaying user-friendly messages for invalid input or server issues).
1. Source Code: All HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP files, well-organized and extensively commented.

### Oral Presentation Focus
- Demonstrate the full end-to-end functionality of your chosen CRUD operation.
- Show how data is stored and retrieved from the server.
- Explain the role of PHP in handling server-side requests and generating dynamic content.
- Discuss any basic security considerations you implemented (e.g., input sanitization, preventing direct file access to data files).
- Highlight any challenges faced during integration and how they were overcome.

### Learning Outcomes

The Cycle 01 submission addresses the following topic learning outcomes:

1. Determine how human factor principles and system design affects usability
2. Implement user focused software solutions through the effective inclusion of users in the design and development process
3. Appraise human factors research methods for consideration in the planning of user-centric design practices
4. Reflect on ethical, legal and security issues related to web applications
5. Practically apply user-centric, iterative design practices incorporating rapid feedback integration
6. ~~Prepare, conduct and evaluate user experience experiments for interactive, web-based systems~~
7. Work independently and in a team on designing, creating and maintaining applications for the web
8. Communicate effectively, using technical language with other IT professionals

### Assessment and Submission

Your submission will be assessed on the quality and completeness of the presentation of your full solution, as well as the quality of the code solution implemented. The submission should be visually consistent with the UX Design from Cycle 1, but should enhance the features with suitable brand colour choices, images, and themes.

#### Marking Rubric

| Criteria | 100-85% (HD) | 84-75% (DN) | 74-65% (CR) | 64-50% (P) | 49-0% (F) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PHP Functionality | Robust, efficient, and correctly implements all planned server-side logic, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of backend processes and dynamic content generation. | Mostly robust and efficient, implementing most planned server-side logic, with only minor areas where functionality could be optimized or extended. | Basic server-side logic implemented, though it may have minor issues that occasionally impact performance or user experience. | Limited or non-functional server-side logic, where critical features are missing or consistently buggy, preventing the application from fully delivering dynamic content and relying excessively on static elements despite the objective. This indicates a fundamental gap in server-side processing capabilities. | Non-functional server-side logic or entirely absent, rendering the application static or broken and fundamentally failing the objective of a full-stack prototype. |
| CRUD Implementation | All CRUD operations for core functionality are fully functional and secure, showcasing comprehensive mastery of data manipulation and user interaction. | Most CRUD operations are functional, with minor security considerations that could be addressed for enhanced robustness. | Some CRUD operations are functional, but with limited security considerations, meaning certain data manipulations may work but are vulnerable or lack completeness. | Incomplete or non-functional CRUD operations, where core functionality is largely missing, significantly buggy, or exhibits major security flaws. For instance, attempts to `Create` data may fail silently, or `Update` operations might corrupt existing records, indicating a failure to establish reliable data interaction. | Non-functional or entirely absent CRUD operations for the core functionality, meaning the application cannot perform its primary data-driven tasks at all. |
| Data Persistence | Data is consistently and reliably stored and retrieved, demonstrating effective management of persistent data across sessions. | Data is mostly consistently stored and retrieved, with only infrequent or minor inconsistencies. | Data persistence works, but may have minor inconsistencies that occasionally require user intervention or lead to unexpected behavior. | Data persistence is unreliable or non-existent, characterized by frequent loss or corruption of data, or a failure to preserve data between user sessions as required. This suggests a critical flaw in the data storage mechanism. | Data persistence is non-existent, meaning data does not save or retrieve at all, fundamentally failing the requirement to store data between sessions. |
| Integration | Seamless integration between frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) and backend (PHP), resulting in a cohesive and fluid user experience. | Good integration, with only minor areas for improvement in the flow between frontend and backend components. | Acceptable integration, though some noticeable seams or inefficiencies are present that may slightly hinder user experience. | Poor integration, where the frontend and backend are noticeably disjointed with severe inefficiencies, impacting usability. This can manifest as slow load times for dynamic content, unresponsive UI elements, or errors stemming from miscommunication between client and server. | Extremely poor integration, making the application largely unusable due to a completely disjointed frontend and backend, preventing the successful operation of the prototype. |
| Error Handling/Security | Comprehensive error handling and basic security measures implemented effectively, demonstrating foresight in preventing and responding to issues, including basic input sanitization. | Good error handling and some security measures implemented, providing a reasonable level of robustness and user feedback. | Basic error handling, with minimal security considerations, meaning some common issues are addressed but vulnerabilities may persist. | Lacking error handling or security measures, leading to a poor user experience when invalid inputs are provided (e.g., raw PHP errors displayed instead of user-friendly messages) or posing significant risks (e.g., no input sanitization, potential direct file access to data files). This indicates insufficient attention to application robustness and user trust. | Completely lacking error handling and security measures, posing significant risks or immediate failure upon invalid input, making the application extremely vulnerable or unstable. |
| Code Quality | Clean, well-commented, efficient, and follows best practices for PHP, demonstrating professional coding standards and maintainability. | Good comments, generally efficient, and follows most best practices for PHP, contributing to readability and maintainability. | Some comments present, minor inefficiencies, and inconsistent practices for PHP, which may slightly impede readability or future development. | Code is poorly commented and inefficient, making it difficult to understand in significant parts. This often results in redundant logic, unclear variable names, or a lack of structural organization, making it challenging to debug, extend, or evaluate the underlying functionality. | Code is unreadable, completely uncommented, or non-functional, making evaluation impossible and demonstrating a severe lack of attention to maintainability and professional standards. |
| Oral Presentation | Engaging, clear demonstration, confidently explains full-stack architecture, proficiently addressing how data is stored, retrieved, and PHP's role in handling requests and security. | Clear demonstration, explains full-stack architecture well, effectively covering key components and their interaction. | Understandable demonstration, with a basic explanation of the architecture, covering the core functions but potentially lacking depth on intricate details. | Demonstration is unclear, and explanation of architecture is very basic or mostly incorrect. The student may struggle to articulate the full end-to-end functionality of their CRUD operation, how data persists, or the specific role of PHP in their solution, indicating a superficial understanding of their own project's full-stack nature. | Unable to demonstrate core functionality or explain the architecture meaningfully, indicating a complete lack of grasp of the project's technical aspects or inability to present effectively. |

For this assessment task, students are permitted to use AI for some or most elements of the task and demonstrate effective use of AI. They are expected to evaluate output irrespective of how it is attained, include all prompts and output in an appendix, and acknowledge and cite AI created content in their final submission.

#### How should the use of AI be acknowledged in the assessment task?

Students must provide a declaration acknowledging which AI technologies have been used and how (add a file to the `cycle3` folder, named `AI-acknowledgement.md`). Drafts should be kept demonstrating authorship and may be requested by assessors. The `AI-acknowledgement.md` file should contain all prompts and output generated from AI, and must be included with the final submission.

For example (start the `AI-Acknowledgement.md` file with the following statement):

- I acknowledge the use of ChatGPT in generating content included in this submission (OpenAI, Year). The prompts and output from ChatGPT are included in the file below.

A reference to the use of AI should be included in the reference list.

For example:

Within your reports: 

- (Year). ChatGPT (Month, Year, Version) [Large language model]. https://<!--comments-->chat.openai.<!--comment-->com/chat

Within your code:
- Immediately after lines of final code in your project where you have used AI to improve your work:
```
#-# START COMMENT BLOCK #-#
AI Tool used
Line number in AI-Acknowledgement.md where you captured this work
Your personal interpretation of the response from genAI - comment on what it means to you
#-# END COMMENT BLOCK #-#
```

**Academic Integrity**\
The misuse of generative AI or the failure to acknowledge the use of generative AI will be considered a breach of [Academic Integrity](https://students.flinders.edu.au/my-course/academic-integrity).
